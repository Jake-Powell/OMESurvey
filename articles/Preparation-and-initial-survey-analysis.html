</h3>
<p>Our first aim is to clean the data such that the data is ready to be
analysed and no further modifications are required. Note that after the
first clean we will need to do sanity checks in case there are other
issues in the data.</p>
<p>The initial part of cleaning will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding theme / group information to the column names. To using the
tools herein the column name of questions should be in the format
<code>XX__YY</code> where XX is the theme/group and YY the question (i.e
we use ’__’ double underscore to represent the split between group/theme
and the question).</li>
<li>Convert ‘N-A’ to NA.</li>
<li>Get the school ID from the bar code.</li>
<li>Create a combined school and class ID (in case multiple schools have
the same class ID).</li>
</ul>

<p>We see that most errors occur from casing issues (capital N in
never), since this isn’t case specific to this survey we can fix this
using <code><a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/case.html" class="external-link">stringr::str_to_sentence()</a></code> in the cleaning section
(which is already there just commented out to show the issue). The issue
of ‘Neither’ being used instead of ‘Half the time’ is case specific and
can be fixed for this individual report.</p>

<p>Note that by default this creates a .html report where the charts are
interactive (i.e has hover enabled, plus potential other features). This
allows for more informative charts however it comes at the cost of not
been able to edit the document. Therefore using the input
<code>report_kind = 'static'</code> will render the same report except
the output will be in .docx allowing text to be edited/added at the
expense of the interactive plots (where they will be replaced with
static screengrabs).</p>
