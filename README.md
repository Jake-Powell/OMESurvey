📦 The `OMESurvey` package contains tools for pre-processing and
analysing survey data for the OME. in particular:

- converting raw survey data into publishable excel workbooks,
- pre-processing helpers,
- plotting functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OMESurvey from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jake-Powell/OMESurvey")
```

## Examples

### Plotting survey result

``` r
library(OMESurvey)
data = OMESurvey::survey_example

OMESurvey::plot_theme(data, theme = 'Theme_1', kind = 'ggplot')
#> Warning in OMESurvey::plot_theme(data, theme = "Theme_1", kind = "ggplot"): The
#> expected answers are: "Agree a lot", "Agree a little", "Neither", "Disagree a
#> little", "Disagree a lot" which does not include the following found in the
#> data: "N-A"
```

### Checking for issues in a survey

Use `check_survey()` to search for unexpected responses (for non free
text), issues with the barcode and locations of questions with multiple
answers (“99”)

``` r
check = OMESurvey::survey_example |>
  OMESurvey::convert_NA() |>
  OMESurvey::check_survey()
check
#> $barcode
#> $barcode$isIssue
#> [1] FALSE
