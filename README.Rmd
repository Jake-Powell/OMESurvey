ðŸ“¦ The `OMESurvey` package contains tools for analysing survey data for the OME, in particular (for now) converting raw survey data into publishable excel workbooks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OMESurvey from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jake-Powell/OMEStools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(OMESurvey)
data = OMESurvey::survey_example

## Add theme information

OMESurvey::plot_theme(data, theme = 'Theme_1', kind = 'ggplot')
## basic example code
```
